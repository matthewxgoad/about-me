            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Originally from Memphis, I've lived in St. Louis now for a decade. I moved away briefly to persue working in television. </p>
            <p>While I enjoyed it, I missed home and came back to try a career left-turn into coding. It's something I've alway had an interest in and I believe I have an aptitude for. I'm very excited for this class and to see where this takes me.</p>
            <p>For several years I hosted a web series called <em>Cocktail Moment</em>. I loved doing that and I'd like to get back into doing it again.</p>
